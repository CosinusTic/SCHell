Shell:
    - Optional arguments (ex for ls)
    - SIGINT handling
    - 

Window:
    - Implement PTY architecture:
        --> Master: window process
        --> Slave: assigned to the shell process
        --> Steps:
            1* System request to allocate a psoeudo terminal (create PTY pair)
            2* Fork the shell process and redirect stdin, stdout, stderr to the 
            slave end
            3* Interact with the paster in window (read output, send input)
    - GUI for master user input and slave output
